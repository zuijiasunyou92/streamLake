\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we build a data lake storage system \sys that facilitates stream and batch data processing with high elasticity, reliability, scalability, efficiency. We adopt the compute-and-storage disaggregated architecture to achieve  elasticity and reliability via the stream object and table object. We implement the lakehouse functionality to support ACID for tabular data with a global write cache to achieve acceleration.  Moreover, we design \brain at the storage side so as to achieve query and resource optimization in the storage  disaggregated architecture. We have deployed \sys in Chine Mobile to storage and process 20PB production data with high performance and low cost.
