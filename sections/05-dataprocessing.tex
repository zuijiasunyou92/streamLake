\section{Streamlake Data Processing} 
\label{sec:dataeva}

In this Section, we present the data processing services  in the data layer. Driven by practical application scenarios discussed in Section~\ref{sec:motivation}, these services provide a comprehensive, enterprise-level data lake storage solution  to efficiently store and process  log messages\footnote{*why emphasize log messages here? what is the connection with the following sentence?} at scale. The StreamLake services encompass a stream storage system for message streaming (Section~\ref{subsec:stream}), lakehouse-format read/write capabilities for efficient tabular data processing (Section~\ref{subsec:lakehouse}), and support for query operator computation pushdown(Section~\ref{subsec:pushdown}).
